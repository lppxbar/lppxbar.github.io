Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest called real-life stories,
It showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal,
Here is a copy of the drawing,
It said in the book boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing then they are not able to move and they sleep for the six months it takes for digestion,
So I thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and in turn I managed with a colored pencil to make my first drawing my drawing number one,
It looked like this,
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups and I asked them if my drawing frightened them,
They answered me why would anyone be frightened by a hat,
My drawing was not of a hat,
It showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant,
I then drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownups could understand,
They always need to have things explained,
My drawing number two looked like this,
The grownups advised me to leave aside drawings of boa constrictors open or closed and to apply myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar,
Thus I abandoned at the age of six a magnificent career as a painter,
I was discouraged by the failure of my drawing number one and of my drawing number two,
Grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to always explain things for them again and again,
So I had to choose another profession and I learned to fly airplanes,
I flew a little in many places around the world and geography it is true has served me well,
I could recognize at first glance china from arizona,
It is very useful if you get lost at night,
I have had during my life a lot of contact with many persons of consequence,
I have lived a lot amongst the grownups,
I have seen them from close up,
It has not much improved my opinion of them,
Whenever I met one of them that seemed a bit more clear-sighted I tried the experiment of showing them my drawing number one that I have always kept,
I wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding but they always responded it is a hat,
So I would never speak to them of boa constrictors nor of primeval forests nor of the stars,
I put myself at their level,
I talked to them about bridge golf politics and neckties and the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man,
So I lived alone without anyone I could really talk to until a breakdown in the sahara desert six years ago,
Something had broken in my engine and as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers I readied myself to try and carry out all alone the difficult repairs,
For me it was a matter of life or death,
I had hardly enough water to drink for a week,
The first night I went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation,
I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean,
So you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak a funny little voice woke me up,
It said please draw me a sheep,
What,
Draw me a sheep,
I jumped to my feet as if I had been struck by lightning,
I rubbed my eyes,
I took a good look around me and I saw a quite extraordinary little man who was examining me seriously,
Here is the best portrait that later I managed to do of him but my drawing of course is much less charming than its model,
It is not my fault,
I was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups at the age of six and I had not learned to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open,
I stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment,
Remember that I was a thousand miles from any inhabited region and yet this little fellow seemed neither lost nor half dead with fatigue nor starved or dying of thirst or fear,
He looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region,
When I finally managed to speak I said what are you doing here,
And he repeated very slowly as if it was something very serious please draw me a sheep,
When a mystery is too overpowering one dare not disobey,
Absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen,
But then I remembered that I had mainly studied geography history arithmetic and grammar and I told the little fellow a little crossly that I did not know how to draw,
He replied it does not matter,
Draw me a sheep,
As I had never drawn a sheep I redrew for him one of the only two drawings that I was capable of,
The one of the closed boa constrictor,
And I was astounded to hear the little fellow respond no no I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor,
A boa constrictor is very dangerous and an elephant is very cumbersome,
Where I live everything is very small,
I need a sheep,
Draw me a sheep,
So I drew,
He looked carefully then said no this one is already very sick,
Make another one,
I drew again,
My friend smiled gently and indulgently,
You can see yourself this is not a sheep,
It is a ram,
It has horns,
So once again I redid my drawing,
But it was rejected like the previous ones,
This one is too old,
I want a sheep that will live a long time,
So getting impatient as I was eager to start dismantling my engine I hastily sketched this drawing and I snapped this,
Here is the box,
The sheep you want is inside,
But I was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up,
It is exactly the way I wanted,
Do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass,
Why,
Because where I am from everything is very small,
There will certainly be enough,
I gave you a very small sheep,
He leaned his head towards the drawing,
Not that small,
Look,
He is fallen asleep,
And that is how I met the little prince,
It took me a long time to find out where he came from,
The little prince who asked me many questions never seemed to hear my own,
It was the words spoken by chance that little by little revealed everything to me,
So when he saw my airplane for the first time,
I will not draw my airplane,
It would be a drawing far too complicated for me,
He asked me what is that thing there,
It is not a thing,
It flies,
It is an airplane,
It is my airplane,
And I was proud to have him know that I could fly,
Then he cried what you fell from the sky,
Yes I said modestly,
Oh that is funny,
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much,
I prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously,
Then he added so you also come from the sky,
What planet are you from,
I caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and I asked abruptly so you come from another planet then,
But he did not answer,
He shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane,
It is true that you can not have come from far away in that and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while,
Then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure,
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets so I tried to find out more,
Where are you from my little fellow,
Where is this where I live of yours,
Where do you take my sheep off to,
After a reflective silence he answered what is good about the box you have given is that at night he can use it as a house,
That is right and if you are good I will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a stake,
The offer seemed to shock the little prince,
Tie him up,
What a funny idea,
But if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost,
My friend broke into another peal of laughter,
Where do you think he would go,
Anywhere straight ahead,
Then the little prince said gravely that does not matter,
Where I live everything is so small,
And perhaps with a hint of sadness he added straight ahead you can not go far,
I thus learned a second very important thing that his home planet was barely bigger than a house,
It did not surprise me much,
I knew that apart from the large planets like the earth jupiter mars and venus which have been given names there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope,
When an astronomer discovers one of these he gives it a number for a name,
He might call it for example asteroid 325,
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b612,
This asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in 1909 by a turkish astronomer,
He had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference but nobody had believed him because of his outfit,
Grownups are like that,
Fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b612 a turkish dictator imposed on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the european fashion,
The astronomer gave his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly and this time everybody believed him,
If I have told you these details about the asteroid b612 and revealed to you its number it is because of the grownups,
Grownups love numbers,
When you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things,
They never ask you how does his voice sound,
What games does he like best,
Does he collect butterflies,
They ask how old is he,
How many brothers does he have,
How much does he weigh,
How much money does his father make,
Only then do they think they know him,
If you said to the grownups I saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their minds,
You would have to tell them I saw a hundred thousand franc house and they would cry how pretty,
So if you were to say to them the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming,
He laughed and he wanted a sheep,
If someone wants a sheep that proves they exist,
They would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child,
But if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid b612 they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their questions,
They are like that,
Do not blame them,
Children should be forgiving towards the grownups,
But of course those of us who understand life we do not much care for numbers,
I would have liked to begin this story in the same way as a fairy tale,
I would have liked to say once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet not much bigger than himself and who needed a friend,
For those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural,
For I do not want my book to be read lightly,
I feel so much sadness in recounting these memories,
It is already been six years since my friend left with his sheep,
If I try to describe him here it is so as not to forget him,
It is sad to forget a friend,
Not everyone has had a friend and if I forgot him I could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers,
So that is why I have again bought a box of paints and some pencils,
It is hard to take up drawing again at my age when I have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six,
I will try of course to make my portraits as lifelike as possible but I am not quite sure I will succeed,
Some drawings go alright,
Others do not look like their subjects,
I also get the size a bit wrong,
Here the little prince is too big,
There he is too small,
I am also not sure about the color of his outfit so I fumble along somehow as best I can,
I will make mistakes on certain important points too but you will have to forgive me that my friend never gave explanations,
Perhaps he thought I was just like himself but I unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through boxes,
Perhaps I am a bit like the grownups,
I must have got older,
Every day I would learn something about his planet the departure and the trip,
The information came slowly as his thoughts wandered,
It was in this way that on the third day I came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs,
This time again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt,
It is true is not it that sheep eat shrubs,
Yes it is true,
Oh I am glad,
I did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs but the little prince added then it follows they also eat baobabs,
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab,
The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh,
They would have to be piled up on top of each other,
But he remarked wisely the baobab trees before they grow up start off small,
That is right but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs,
He replied oh come on as if it were obvious and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help,
And indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and bad plants and therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants,
But seeds are invisible,
They sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up,
Then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig,
If it is a sprig of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes,
But if it is a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised,
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince,
There were the seeds of baobab trees,
The soil of the planet was infested with them,
A baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of,
It takes over the entire planet pierces it with its roots,
And if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs they shatter it to pieces,
It is a matter of discipline,
The little prince told me later,
After grooming oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groomed,
You must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes to which they look very similar when they are very young,
It is a very boring job but very easy,
And one day he suggested that I apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the children from where I come would understand all this,
If one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful,
Sometimes there is no harm in postponing one s work but in the case of baobabs that always leads to a catastrophe,
I used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man,
He had neglected three little bushes,
And based on what the little prince told me I drew this planet,
I do not like to sound like a moralist but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that for once I am breaking my normal reserve,
I say children beware of baobabs,
It is to warn my friends of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that I have worked so hard on this drawing,
The lesson which I pass on by this means was worth the effort,
You might be wondering why is it that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs,
The answer is simple,
I tried but I could not succeed,
When I drew the baobabs I was spurred on by a sense of urgency,
Oh little prince I came to understand gradually in this way your sad life,
For a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets,
I learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you said to me I am very fond of sunsets,
Let us go and see a sunset now,
But we have to wait,
Wait for what,
Wait until the sun goes down,
You seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself and you said I think myself at home still,
Indeed when it is noon in the united states the sun everybody knows is setting over france,
It would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able to see a sunset,
Unfortunately france is much too far away but on your tiny planet all you needed was to move your chair a few steps and you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked,
One day I saw the sunset forty four times,
And a little later you added you know you love the sunset when you are really sad,
The day you saw it forty four times were you really that sad then,
But the little prince made no reply,
On the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince s life was revealed to me,
He asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem,
If a sheep eats shrubs then does it eat flowers too,
A sheep eats everything it finds,
Even flowers that have thorns,
Yes even flowers that have thorns,
What are the thorns for then,
I did not know the answer,
I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck,
I was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious and I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear the worst,
What are the thorns for then,
The little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it,
I was upset over the bolt and I said the first thing that came into my head,
The thorns are of no use at all,
Flowers have thorns just for spite,
Oh,
But after a moment of silence he exclaimed with a sort of resentment,
I do not believe you,
Flowers are weak creatures,
They are naive,
They reassure themselves as best they can,
They think themselves frightful with their thorns,
I made no reply,
At that moment I was thinking to myself if this bolt will not budge I will knock it out with a hammer,
The little prince interrupted my thoughts again,
And you actually believe that flowers,
No no I do not believe it at all,
I answered the first thing that came to my mind,
I myself am busy with matters of consequence,
He looked at me dumbfounded,
Matters of consequence,
He watched me hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly,
You talk just like the grownups,
That made me feel a little ashamed but he went on relentlessly,
You confuse everything,
You mix everything up,
He was really very angry,
He shook his golden curls in the breeze,
I know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman,
He has never smelled a flower,
He has never looked at a star,
He has never loved anyone,
He has never done anything but sums and all day long he repeats just like you,
I am busy with matters of consequence,
And that makes him swell up with pride,
But this is not a man,
He is a mushroom,
A what,
A mushroom,
The little prince was now white with rage,
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years,
For millions of years the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same,
And it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use,
Is the war between the flowers and sheep not important,
Is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman,
And if I myself know of a unique flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realising what he is done,
Is that not important,
He blushed and continued,
If someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them,
He can say my flower is out there somewhere,
But if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out,
And you think that is not important,
He could not say anything more,
He suddenly burst into tears,
Night had fallen,
I had put down my tools of what moment was my hammer my bolt or thirst or death,
There was on a star on a planet my planet earth a little prince to be comforted,
I took him in my arms,
I rocked him,
I said the flower that you love is not in danger,
I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep,
I will draw you a railing for your flower,
I,
I,
I was not sure what to say,
I felt very awkward,
I did not know how to reach him where to find him,
It is so secretive the land of tears,
I learned very quickly to know this flower better,
There had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone,
They would appear one morning in the grass and by evening they would have faded away,
But this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no one knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts,
It could have been a new kind of baobab,
But the shrub soon stopped growing and began to produce a flower,
The little prince who witnessed the appearance of a huge bud felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it,
But the flower never stopped preparing for her future beauty,
Safe in her green chamber she chose her colors carefully,
She dressed slowly,
She arranged her petals one by one,
She did not want to come out all rumpled like the poppies,
She would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty,
Oh yes she was a very flirtatious creature,
And her mysterious adornment had thus lasted for days and days,
Then one morning exactly at sunrise she suddenly showed herself,
And after having worked with such care and attention to detail she said with a yawn oh I have only just woken up,
I do apologize,
I am not yet presentable,
The little prince could not restrain his admiration,
You are so beautiful,
Am I not,
The flower responded sweetly,
And I was born at the same moment as the sun,
The little prince guessed easily enough that she was not very modest,
But how moving she was,
It is time I think for breakfast,
She added an instant later,
If you would have the kindness to think of my needs,
And the little prince completely abashed having gone to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water tended to the flower,
And like that she had soon begun to torment him with her vanity,
One day for example speaking of her four thorns she told the little prince let them come the tigers with their claws,
There are not any tigers on my planet,
The little prince objected,
And tigers do not eat weeds,
I am not a weed,
The flower replied sweetly,
Please forgive me,
I do not fear tigers but I detest drafts,
You would not happen to have a screen,
Detests drafts,
That is bad luck for a plant,
Remarked the little prince,
What a very complicated flower,
In the evening you will put me under a glass dome,
It is very cold where you live,
Where I come from,
But she interrupted herself,
She had come in the form of a seed,
She could not have known anything of other worlds,
Humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong,
The screen,
I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me,
Then she forced a cough to inflict still more remorse,
So the little prince despite the good will of his love had soon come to doubt her,
He had taken seriously words of no importance and had become very unhappy,
I should not have listened to her,
He told me one day,
You should never listen to the flowers,
We must look at them and breathe their fragrance,
Mine perfumed my whole planet but I did not know how to take pleasure in it,
This business of the claws which annoyed me so much should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity,
He continued his confidences,
I did not know how to understand,
I should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words,
She overwhelmed me with her fragrance and light,
I should never have run away,
I should have seen the tenderness behind her contrivances,
Flowers are so contradictory,
But I was too young to know how to love her,
I think that for his escape he took advantage of a migration of a flock of wild birds,
On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order,
He carefully swept out his active volcanoes,
He owned two active volcanoes,
It was very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning,
He also owned an extinct volcano but as he used to say you never know so he cleaned out the extinct volcano too,
If they are well cleaned out volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions,
Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney,
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes,
That is why they cause us no end of trouble,
The little prince also pulled up with a hint of sadness the last little shoots of the baobabs,
He believed he would never return,
But all these familiar tasks seemed on that morning very precious,
And as he watered the flower one last time and prepared to shelter her under her dome he found himself close to tears,
Goodbye he said to the flower but she did not answer,
Goodbye he said again,
The flower coughed but it was not because she had a cold,
I was silly,
She said finally,
I ask your forgiveness,
Try to be happy,
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches,
He stood there all bewildered the dome held in mid air,
He did not understand this quiet sweetness,
Of course I love you,
The flower said to him,
It is my fault that you did not know,
That is of no importance,
But you have been just as foolish as I have,
Try to be happy,
Let the dome be,
I do not want it anymore,
But the wind,
My cold is not all that bad,
The cool night air will do me good,
I am a flower,
But the animals,
I will have to endure two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies,
It seems that they are very beautiful and otherwise who else will come to visit me,
You will be far away,
As for the large animals I am not at all afraid of anything,
I have my claws,
And naively she showed her four thorns,
Then she added do not linger like this,
It is tiresome,
You have decided to leave,
Now go,
For she did not want him to see her crying,
She was such a proud flower,
He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325 326 327 328 329 and 330,
So he began by visiting them to learn more,
The first one was inhabited by a king,
The king was sitting dressed in purple and ermine on a very simple yet majestic throne,
Ah here comes a subject exclaimed the king when he caught sight of the little prince,
And the little prince asked himself how could he recognise me when he has never seen me before,
He did not know that for kings the world is very much simplified,
To them all men are subjects,
Approach so that I may see you better said the king who was very proud to finally be king over somebody,
The little prince looked around him for a place to sit but the planet was completely taken over by the magnificent ermine robe so he remained standing and since he was tired he yawned,
It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,
The monarch said to him I forbid you to do so,
I can not stop myself replied the little prince thoroughly embarrassed,
I have come on a long journey and I have not slept,
Ah then the king said I order you to yawn,
I have not seen anyone yawning for years,
Yawns to me are objects of curiosity,
Come now yawn again,
It is an order,
That frightens me,
I can not any more said the little prince blushing,
Hum hum replied the king then I I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to,
He sputtered a bit and seemed vexed,
For the king fundamentally insisted that his authority be respected,
He did not tolerate disobedience,
He was an absolute monarch but because he was good at heart he gave reasonable orders,
If I ordered a general he would often say if I ordered a general to change himself into a seabird and if the general did not obey me it would not be the general s fault,
It would be my fault,
May I sit down the little prince enquired timidly,
I order you to sit down replied the king who majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle,
But the little prince was astonished the planet was tiny,
Over what could this king really rule,
Sire he said to him excuse my asking you a question,
I order you to ask me a question hastened to say the king,
Sire over what do you rule,
Over everything said the king with a magnificent simplicity,
Over everything the king made a subtle gesture pointing out his planet the other planets and the stars,
Over all that asked the little prince,
Over all that the king answered,
For his rule was not only absolute it was also universal,
And the stars obey you,
Of course the king said,
They obey instantly,
I do not tolerate insubordination,
Such power filled the little prince with wonder,
If he had held it himself he would have been able to watch not forty four but seventy two or even a hundred or even two hundred sunsets on the same day without ever having to move his chair,
And as he felt a bit sad as he remembered his forsaken little planet he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour,
I would like to see a sunset,
Do that for me,
Order the sun to set,
If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly or to write a tragic drama or to change himself into a sea bird and if the general did not carry out the order received which one of us would be in the wrong,
You said the little prince firmly,
Exactly one must ask of each person that which they can give,
The king went on,
Authority is based above all on reason,
If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea they would rise up in revolution,
I have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable,
Then my sunset the little prince reminded him who never forgot a question once he had asked it,
You shall have your sunset,
I shall command it but I shall wait according to my science of government until conditions are favourable,
When will that be inquired the little prince,
Hum hum replied the king who consulted a bulky almanac,
Hum hum that will be about about that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight,
And you will see how well I am obeyed,
The little prince yawned,
He was regretting his lost sunset and then he was already getting a little bored,
I have nothing more to do here,
He said to the king,
I will set off,
Do not go said the king who was very proud of having a subject,
Do not go,
I will make you a minister,
Minister of what,
Minister of of justice,
But there is nobody here to judge,
We do not know that,
The king said to him,
I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom,
I am very old,
I have no space for a carriage and it tires me to walk,
Oh but I have already looked said the little prince who leant over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet,
There was no one there either,
Then you shall judge yourself,
The king answered,
That is the most difficult thing of all,
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else,
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly then you are truly wise,
Yes said the little prince,
But I can judge myself anywhere,
I do not have to live here,
Hum hum said the king,
I am fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat,
I hear him at night,
You can judge this old rat,
From time to time you will condemn him to death thus his life will depend on your justice,
But you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him,
There is only one of him,
I replied the little prince do not like to condemn anyone to death,
And now I think I will go on my way,
No said the king,
But the little prince having readied himself to leave had no wish to grieve the old monarch,
If your majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed he should be able to give me a reasonable order,
He should be able for example to order me to leave within a minute,
It seems to me that conditions are favourable,
As the king made no answer the little prince hesitated at first then with a sigh took his leave,
I make you my ambassador,
The king hastily called out,
He had a magnificent air of authority,
The grownups are very strange,
The little prince said to himself as he continued on his journey,
The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man,
Ah here comes a visit from an admirer exclaimed the conceited man from afar the moment he spotted the little prince,
Because to conceited men all other men are admirers,
Good morning said the little prince,
You have a funny hat,
It is for saluting,
The conceited man replied,
It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me,
Unfortunately nobody ever passes by this way,
Oh really said the little prince who did not understand,
Clap your hands one against the other,
The conceited man advised,
The little prince clapped his hands one against the other,
The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute,
This is more fun than the visit to the king,
The little prince said to himself and he began again to clap his hands one against the other,
The conceited man again raised his hat in a salute,
After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the monotony of the game,
And what should I do he asked to make the hat come down,
But the conceited man did not hear him,
Conceited people never hear anything but praise,
Do you really admire me a lot,
He asked the little prince,
What does that mean to admire,
To admire means to recognise that I am the most handsome the best dressed the richest and the most intelligent man on the planet,
But you are the only man on the planet,
Do it for me,
Admire me just the same,
I admire you said the little prince shrugging his shoulders a little,
But how can that interest you so much,
And the little prince went away,
The grownups are certainly very odd,
He said to himself as he continued his journey,
The next planet was inhabited by a heavy drinker,
This was a very short visit but it plunged the little prince into a deep sadness,
What are you doing there,
He said to the drinker who he found sitting in silence in front of a number of empty bottles and a number of full bottles,
I am drinking replied the drinker gloomily,
Why are you drinking,
The little prince asked him,
To forget replied the drinker,
To forget what asked the little prince who already felt sorry for him,
To forget that I am ashamed confessed the drinker lowering his head,
Ashamed of what inquired the little prince who wanted to help him,
Ashamed of drinking concluded the drinker who then shut himself away in the silence,
And the little prince went away puzzled,
The grownups are certainly very very odd,
He said to himself as he continued on his journey,
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman,
This man was so busy that he did not even raise his head when the little prince arrived,
Good morning the little prince said to him,
Your cigarette has gone out,
Three and two make five,
Five and seven make twelve,
Twelve and three make fifteen,
Good morning,
Fifteen and seven make twenty two,
Twenty two and six make twenty eight,
No time to light it again,
Twenty six and five make thirty one,
Phew phew then that makes five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred and thirty one,
Five hundred million what,
Huh are you still there,
Five hundred and one million I have forgotten now,
I have so much work,
I am a man of consequence,
I do not amuse myself with balderdash,
Two and five make seven,
Five hundred and one million what repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it,
The businessman raised his head,
During the fifty four years that I have lived on this planet I have only been disturbed three times,
The first time was twenty two years ago by some scatterbrain who fell from god knows where,
He made the most dreadful noise and I made four mistakes in a sum,
The second time was eleven years ago by an attack of rheumatism,
I do not get enough exercise,
I do not have time to stroll about,
I am a man of consequence,
The third time well this is it,
I was saying then five hundred and one million,
Millions of what,
The businessman realised that there was no hope of being left in peace,
Millions of those little objects that you see sometimes in the sky,
Flies,
No no the little things that shine,
Bees,
No no the little golden things that make lazy men daydream,
As for me I am a man of consequence,
I have no time to daydream,
Ah the stars,
Yes that is it the stars,
And what do you do with five hundred million stars,
Five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred thirty one,
I am a man of consequence,
I am precise,
And what do you do with these stars,
What do I do with them,
Yes,
Nothing,
I own them,
You own the stars,
Yes,
But I have already seen a king who,
Kings do not own,
They reign over,
It is very different,
And how does owning the stars help you,
It helps by making me rich,
And how does being rich help you,
To buy more stars if someone discovers some more,
This man the little prince said to himself reasons a bit like my poor drinker,
But he still had some questions,
How can you own the stars,
Who owns them,
The businessman retorted grumpily,
I do not know,
Nobody does,
Then they belong to me because I thought of it first,
Is that all that is necessary,
Certainly,
When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody it is yours,
When you discover an island that belongs to nobody it is yours,
When you get an idea first you take out a patent it is yours,
And I own the stars because no one before me ever thought of owning them,
Yes that is true said the little prince,
And what do you do with them,
I administer them,
I count them and recount them said the businessman,
It is difficult but I am a man of consequence,
The little prince was still not satisfied,
If I owned a scarf I could put it around my neck and take it away with me,
If I owned a flower I could pick my flower and take it away with me,
But you can not pick the stars,
No but I can put them in the bank,
What does that mean,
That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper and then I lock this paper in a drawer and that is all that is enough,
That is funny thought the little prince,
It is rather poetic but it is of no great consequence,
On matters of consequence the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grownups,
I myself he continued own a flower that I water every day,
I own three volcanoes that I sweep out every week as I also sweep out the one that is extinct,
You never know,
It is of some use to my volcanoes and it is of some use to my flower that I own them,
But you are of no use to the stars,
The businessman opened his mouth but he found nothing to say in response,
And the little prince went away,
The grownups are certainly altogether extraordinary,
He said to himself as he continued on the journey,
The fifth planet was very strange,
It was the smallest of them all,
There was just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter,
The little prince could not work out the purpose of having a street lamp and a lamplighter somewhere out in the skies on a planet without any houses or people,
He said to himself nevertheless it may well be that this man is absurd,
But he is less absurd than the king than the conceited man the businessman or the drinker,
At least his work has some meaning,
When he lights his lamp it is as if he is bringing to life one more star or one more flower,
When he puts out his lamp he sends the flower or the star to sleep,
That is a beautiful occupation,
It serves a real purpose because it is pretty,
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter,
Good morning,
Why have you just put out your lamp,
Those are the orders replied the lamplighter,
Good morning,
What are the orders,
That I put out my lamp,
Good evening,
And he lit it again,
But why have you just lit it again,
Those are the orders replied the lamplighter,
I do not understand said the little prince,
There is nothing to understand said the lamplighter,
Orders are orders,
Good morning,
And he put out his lamp,
Then he sponged his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares,
I have a terrible profession,
In the old days it was reasonable,
I would put the lamp out in the morning and in the evening I would light it,
I had the rest of the day to rest and the rest of the night to sleep,
And since then have the orders changed,
The orders have not changed said the lamplighter,
That is the tragedy,
Every year the planet has turned faster and faster and the orders have not changed,
So what then said the little prince,
So now that it spins round once every minute,
I no longer have a moment s rest,
Once every minute I light the lamp and put it out again,
That is funny,
Where you live a day only lasts a minute,
It is not funny at all said the lamplighter,
We have already been speaking for a month,
A month,
Yes,
Thirty minutes thirty days,
Good evening,
And he lit his lamp again,
The little prince watched him and felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders,
He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in the past by moving his chair,
He wanted to help his friend,
You know I know a way you can rest whenever you want,
I always want to said the lamplighter,
For it is possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time,
The little prince went on,
Your planet is so small that you can go right round it in three strides,
You only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun when you want to rest,
You can walk and the day will last as long as you like,
That does not do me much good said the lamplighter,
What I really love in life is to sleep,
That is bad luck said the little prince,
That is bad luck said the lamplighter,
Good morning,
And he put out his lamp,
That man said the little prince to himself as he continued further on his journey that man would be despised by all the others by the king by the conceited man by the drinker and by the businessman,
Yet he is the only one that does not seem ridiculous to me,
Perhaps it is because he thinks of something other than himself,
He breathed a sigh of regret and said to himself,
That man is the only one with whom I could have made friends but his planet is really very small,
There is no room on it for two people,
What the little prince did not dare admit to himself was that he missed this blessed planet most of all because of the one thousand four hundred and forty sunsets every day,
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last,
It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote enormous books,
Oh look here comes an explorer,
He cried out when he caught sight of the little prince,
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little,
He had already travelled so far,
Where do you come from,
The old gentleman said to him,
What is that big book said the little prince,
What do you do here,
I am a geographer said the old gentleman,
What is a geographer,
He is a scholar who knows the location of the seas the rivers the towns the mountains and the deserts,
That is very interesting said the little prince,
That really is at last a real profession,
And he glanced around at the planet of the geographer,
He had never seen such a majestic planet before,
Your planet is very beautiful he said,
Are there oceans,
I would not know said the geographer,
Oh,
The little prince was disappointed,
And mountains,
I would not know said the geographer,
And towns and rivers and deserts,
I would not know that either said the geographer,
But you are a geographer,
That is true the geographer said,
But I am not an explorer,
I do not have a single explorer,
It is not for the geographer to count the towns the rivers the mountains the seas the oceans and the deserts,
The geographer is too important to go strolling about,
He does not leave his desk but he receives the explorers,
He asks them questions and he writes down their recollections,
And if any of their recollections seem interesting to him the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer s moral character,
Why is that,
Because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books so would an explorer who drank too much,
Why is that asked the little prince,
Because intoxicated men see double so the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one,
I know someone said the little prince who would make a bad explorer,
That is possible,
So when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order an inquiry is done into his discovery,
You go to see it,
No that would be too complicated,
But one requires the explorer to provide proof,
If for example the discovery in question was of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stones from it,
The geographer suddenly became excited,
But you you come from far away,
You are an explorer,
You must describe your planet to me,
And the geographer having opened his big register sharpened his pencil,
The recitals of explorers are first recorded in pencil,
One waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink,
Well said the geographer,
Oh where I live said the little prince,
It is not very interesting,
Everything is very small,
I have three volcanoes two active volcanoes and one extinct one,
But you never know,
One never knows said the geographer,
I also have a flower,
We do not record flowers said the geographer,
Why is that,
It is the prettiest thing,
Because flowers are ephemeral,
What does that mean ephemeral,
Geography books said the geographer of all books are the most concerned with matters of consequence,
They never become out dated,
It is very rare that a mountain changes position,
It is very rare that an ocean empties itself of its water,
We write about eternal things,
But extinct volcanoes can wake up interrupted the little prince,
What does ephemeral mean,
Whether volcanoes are extinct or active is of no consequence to us said the geographer,
The thing that matters to us is the mountain,
It does not change,
But what does ephemeral mean repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it,
It means which is at risk of imminent disappearance,
Is my flower at risk of imminent disappearance,
Of course,
My flower is ephemeral,
The little prince said to himself,
And she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world,
And I have left her all alone on my planet,
That was his first moment of regret but he took heart once again,
What place would you advise me to visit he asked,
The planet earth replied the geographer,
It has a good reputation,
And the little prince went away thinking of his flower,
So the seventh planet was the earth,
The earth is not just any old planet,
It has one hundred and eleven kings not forgetting of course the negro kings amongst them,
Seven thousand geographers,
Nine hundred thousand businessmen,
Seven million five hundred thousand heavy drinkers,
Three hundred and eleven million conceited men,
That is to say about two billion grownups,
To give you an idea of the size of the earth I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain over the span of the six continents a veritable army of four hundred and sixty two thousand five hundred and eleven streetlamp lighters,
Seen from a distance it made a wonderful spectacle,
The movements of this army were regulated like those of an opera ballet,
First came the turn of the lamplighters of new zealand and australia,
Having set their lamps alight they would go off to bed,
Next came the turn of the lamplighters of china and siberia to enter into the dance,
Then they too would disappear into the wings,
Then came the turn of the lamplighters of russia and the indies,
Then those of africa and europe,
Then those of south america,
Then those of north america,
And never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage,
It was magnificent,
Only the lamplighter of the single lamp of the north pole and his colleague at the single lamp of the south pole led lives of leisure,
They worked twice a year,
When one wants to be witty it can happen that one bends the truth a little,
I have not been entirely honest in telling you about the lamplighters,
I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it,
Men take up very little space on the earth,
If the two billion people who inhabit the earth were to stand upright and squash together a little like for a meeting they would easily fit on one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide,
All humanity could be piled up on the smallest pacific islet,
The grownups of course will not believe you,
They picture themselves as taking up a lot of space,
They think themselves as important as the baobabs,
Therefore you should advise them to do the math,
They adore numbers and that will please them,
But do not waste your time on this chore,
There is no point,
You trust me,
The little prince having arrived on earth was very surprised not to see anyone,
He had already started to worry that he had got the wrong planet when a moon colored coil stirred in the sand,
Good evening said the little prince courteously,
Good evening said the snake,
On what planet have I come down on asked the little prince,
Onto earth in africa the snake answered,
Oh so there is no one on earth,
This is the desert,
There is no one in the deserts,
The earth is large said the snake,
The little prince sat down on a stone and raised his eyes toward the sky,
I wonder he said if the stars are lit so that each of us can one day find his own again,
Look at my planet,
It is right there above us,
But it is so far away,
It is beautiful said the snake,
What has brought you here,
I have been having some trouble with a flower said the little prince,
Ah said the snake,
And they were silent,
Where are the men asked the little prince at last,
It is a bit lonely in the desert,
It is also lonely amongst men the snake said,
The little prince gazed at him for a long time,
You are a funny animal he said finally as thin as a finger,
But I am more powerful than the finger of a king said the snake,
The little prince smiled,
You are not very powerful,
You have not even got any legs,
You can not even travel,
I can carry you further than a ship said the snake,
He wrapped himself around the little prince s ankle like a golden bracelet,
Whoever I touch I send him back to the earth from which he came,
He continued,
But you are pure and you come from a star,
The little prince made no reply,
I feel sorry for you so weak on this earth made of granite,
I can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet,
I can,
I understand very well said the little prince,
but why do you always speak in riddles,
I solve them all said the snake,
And they were silent,
The little prince crossed the desert and met only with one flower a flower with three petals a nondescript flower belonging to no one,
Good morning said the little prince,
Good morning said the flower,
Where are the men asked the little prince politely,
The flower had once seen a caravan passing,
Men I think there exists six or seven of them,
I saw them years ago,
But you never know where to find them,
They are blown here and there by the wind,
They lack roots,
It makes things very difficult for them,
Goodbye said the little prince,
Goodbye said the flower,
The little prince climbed a high mountain,
The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes that came up to his knees and he used the extinct volcano as a footstool,
From a mountain as high as this one he said to himself I will be able to see the entire planet all at once and all the people,
But he saw nothing but sharp needles of rock,
Good morning he said courteously,
Good morning good morning good morning answered the echo,
Who are you said the little prince,
Who are you who are you who are you answered the echo,
Be my friends,
I am all alone he said,
I am all alone all alone all alone answered the echo,
What a funny planet he thought,
It is all dry and all jagged and all barren and the people have no imagination,
They repeat whatever you say to them,
On my planet I had a flower,
She was always the first to speak,
But it happened that the little prince having walked for a long time through the sands rocks and snow at last came across a road and all roads lead to the dwellings of men,
Good morning he said,
It was a garden covered in roses,
Good morning said the roses,
Good morning,
Good morning,
Good morning,
The little prince gazed at them,
They all looked just like his flower,
Who are you he asked them stunned,
We are roses the roses said,
We are roses,
We are roses,
We are roses,
Oh said the little prince,
And he suddenly felt very unhappy,
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe and here were five thousand of them all alike in one single garden,
She would be very upset he said to himself if she saw this,
She would cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid being laughed at and I would have to pretend to nurse her back to life to humble myself also because if I did not she really would allow herself to die,
Then he said to himself I thought I was rich with a flower that was one of a kind and all I have is a common rose,
That and my three volcanoes that come up to my knees,
One which is perhaps forever extinct,
That does not make me a very great prince and lying in the grass he started to cry,
It was then that the fox appeared,
Good morning said the fox,
Good morning responded the little prince politely who then turned around but saw nothing,
I am right here the voice said under the apple tree,
Who are you asked the little prince,
You are very pretty,
I am a fox the fox said,
Come and play with me proposed the little prince,
I am so unhappy,
I can not play with you said the fox,
I am not tamed,
Oh I am sorry said the little prince,
But after some thought he added what does that mean tame,
You are not from here said the fox,
What is it that you are looking for,
I am looking for men said the little prince,
What does tame mean,
Men said the fox they have guns and they hunt,
It is very bothersome,
They also raise chickens,
It is their sole interest,
Are you looking for chickens,
No said the little prince,
I am looking for friends,
What does tame mean,
It is something that is too often forgotten said the fox,
It means to establish bonds,
To establish bonds,
That is right said the fox,
To me you are still only a little boy just like a hundred thousand other little boys,
And I do not need you and you do not need me either,
To you I am only a fox just like a hundred thousand other foxes,
But if you tame me we will need each other,
To me you will be unique in the entire world,
To you I will be unique in the entire world,
I am beginning to understand said the little prince,
There is a flower,
I think she has tamed me,
It is possible said the fox,
On earth you see all kinds of things,
Oh but she is not on earth said the little prince,
The fox seemed very intrigued,
On another planet,
Yes,
Are there hunters on that planet,
No,
That is interesting,
And chickens,
No,
Nothing is perfect sighed the fox,
But the fox came back to his idea,
My life is very monotonous,
I hunt chickens,
Men hunt me,
All the chickens look alike and all the men look alike,
So I get a bit bored,
But if you tame me it would bring some sunlight into my life,
I would come to know a sound of footsteps,
Unlike any other other footsteps send me hurrying back underground yours would call me out of my burrow like music,
And then look you see the wheat fields down there,
I do not eat bread,
Wheat is of no use to me,
The wheat fields mean nothing to me and that is sad,
But your hair is the color of gold so it will be wonderful when you have tamed me,
The wheat which is golden will remind me of you and I will love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat,
The fox went silent and gazed at the little prince for a long time,
Please tame me he said,
I really want to the little prince replied,
But I do not have much time,
I have friends to discover and many things to understand,
One only understands the things that one tames said the fox,
Men no longer have the time to get to know anything,
They buy things ready made in the shops,
But as there are not any shops that sell friends men no longer have any friends,
If you want a friend tame me,
What should I do asked the little prince,
You have to be very patient replied the fox,
First you will sit down a little way away from me like this in the grass,
I will watch you out of the corner of my eye and you will not say anything,
Words are a source of misunderstandings,
But every day you will be able to sit a little closer,
The next day the little prince came back,
It would have been better to come back at the same time of day said the fox,
If you come for example at four o clock in the afternoon from three o clock I would start to feel happy as the time got nearer,
I would feel happier and happier already by four o clock,
I would be jumping about and getting restless,
I would come to learn the price of happiness,
But if you come at just any time I would never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you,
We must observe the rites,
What is a rite asked the little prince,
They are also something too often forgotten said the fox,
They are what make make one day different from other days one hour different from other hours,
There is a rite for example among my hunters,
On thursdays they dance with the girls of the village so thursday is a wonderful day,
I can go for a walk as far as the vineyards,
If the hunters danced on just any day all the days would be alike and I had never have any rest,
So the little prince tamed the fox,
And when the time to leave drew near oh said the fox I will cry,
It is your fault said the little prince,
I never wished you any harm but you wanted me to tame you,
I know said the fox,
But you are going to cry said the little prince,
I know said the fox,
So all this has done you no good at all,
It has done me good said the fox,
Because of the color of the wheat,
And then he added go and see the roses again,
You will understand that yours is unique in the entire world,
Then come back to say goodbye to me and I will make you a present of a secret,
The little prince went away to see the roses again,
You are not like my rose at all,
You are nothing yet he told them,
No one has tamed you and you have not tamed anyone,
You are like my fox used to be,
He was only a fox just like a hundred thousand others but I have made him my friend and now he is unique in the entire world,
And the roses were very embarrassed,
You are beautiful but you are empty he went on,
One could not die for you,
Of course an ordinary passer by would think that my rose looked just like you,
But she alone is more important than all of you because it is her that I watered,
Because it is her that I put under the glass dome,
Because it is her that I sheltered behind the screen,
Because it is for her that I killed the caterpillars except two or three to become butterflies,
Because it is her that I listened to grumble or boast or even sometimes when she said nothing,
Because she is my rose,
And he went back to the fox,
Goodbye he said,
Goodbye said the fox,
Here is my secret,
It is very simple,
One only sees clearly with the heart,
What is essential is invisible to the eye,
What is essential is invisible to the eye repeated the little prince so as to remember,
It is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important,
It is the time that I have wasted on my rose said the little prince so as to remember,
The men have forgotten this truth said the fox but you must not forget it,
You become forever responsible for that which you have tamed,
You are responsible for your rose,
I am responsible for my rose repeated the little prince so as to remember,
Good morning said the little prince,
Good morning said the railway switchman,
What do you do here the little prince asked,
I sort travelers in packs of a thousand said the switchman,
I dispatch the trains that carry them sometimes to the right sometimes to the left,
And a brilliantly lit express train rumbling like thunder shook the switchman s cabin,
They really are in a hurry said the little prince,
What is it that they are looking for,
Not even the locomotive engineer knows that said the switchman,
A second brilliantly lit express thundered by in the opposite direction,
Are they back already asked the little prince,
These are not the same ones said the switchman,
It is an exchange,
Were not they happy where they were,
No one is ever happy where they are said the switchman,
A third brilliantly lit express thundered by,
Are they chasing after the first travelers asked the little prince,
They are not chasing after anything at all said the switchman,
They are asleep in there or if not they are yawning,
Only the children are squashing their noses up against the windows,
Only the children know what they are after said the little prince,
They waste their time with a rag doll and it becomes very important to them,
And if someone takes it away from them they cry,
They are lucky said the switchman,
Good morning said the little prince,
Good morning said the merchant,
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst,
You could take one pill a week and you no longer felt the need to drink anything,
Why are you selling those asked the little prince,
It is a big time saver said the merchant,
Experts have done calculations,
You save fifty three minutes per week,
And what do I do with the fifty three minutes,
You can do anything you like with them,
Myself the little prince said to himself if I had fifty three minutes to spend as I liked I would walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water,
We were at the eighth day since my accident in the desert and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I drank the last drop of my water supply,
Ah I said to the little prince these memories of yours are very charming,
But I have not managed to repair my plane yet,
I have nothing left to drink and I too would be happy if I could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water,
My friend the fox he said to me,
My dear fellow our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore,
Why not,
Because we will die of thirst,
He did not follow my reasoning and he answered me,
It is nice to have had a friend even if you are about to die,
Myself I am glad to have had a fox as a friend,
He never considers the danger I said to myself,
He has never been hungry or thirsty,
A little sunshine is all he needs,
But he looked at me and replied to my thought,
I am also thirsty,
Let us look for a well,
I made a gesture of weariness,
It is absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert but we started walking anyway,
When we had walked for hours in silence night fell and the stars began to come out,
I saw them as if in a dream as my thirst had made me feverish,
The little prince s words danced in my memory,
So you are also thirsty I asked him,
But he did not reply to my question,
He said simply water can be good for the heart too,
I did not understand his answer but I said nothing,
I knew better than to press my questions,
He was tired,
He sat down,
I sat down beside him and after a silence he spoke again,
The stars are beautiful because of a flower that can not be seen,
I replied that is true,
And I looked without saying anything at the folds of sand in the moonlight,
The desert is beautiful the little prince added,
And it was true,
I have always loved the desert,
You sit down on a sand dune,
You see nothing,
You hear nothing and yet something radiates forth in the silence,
What makes the desert beautiful said the little prince is that somewhere it hides a well,
I was surprised to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sands,
When I was a little boy I lived in an old house and legend told that a treasure was buried there,
Of course no one had ever been able to find it or perhaps no one had even looked for it,
But it cast an enchantment over that house,
My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart,
Yes I said to the little prince,
Whether the house the stars or the desert what gives them their beauty is something invisible,
I am glad he said that you agree with my fox,
As the little prince fell asleep I took him in my arms and set out walking again,
I felt deeply moved,
It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure,
It even seemed to me that there was nothing more fragile on earth,
I looked in the moonlight at his pale forehead his closed eyes his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
And I said to myself what I see here is only a shell,
That which is most important is invisible,
As his slightly parted lips gave way to a half smile I continued what I find so deeply moving about this little sleeping prince is his devotion to a flower,
It is the image of a rose that shines in him like the flame of a lamp even when he is sleeping,
And I came to think of him as even more fragile,
One has to look after lamps,
A gust of wind can put them out,
And continuing to walk I found the well at daybreak,
Men said the little prince stuff themselves into express trains but they do not know what they are looking for,
So they rush about and go in circles and he added it is not worth it,
The well we had reached was not like the other wells of the sahara,
The wells of the sahara are mere holes dug in the sand,
This one looked like a village well but there was no village there and I thought I was dreaming,
It is strange I said to the little prince,
Everything has been prepared the pulley the bucket and the rope,
He laughed took the rope and put the pulley to work,
And the pulley moaned like an old weathervane when there has long been no wind,
Can you hear that said the little prince,
We have woken up the well and it is singing,
I did not want him to tire himself out,
Let me do it I said,
It is too heavy for you,
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level,
The song of the pulley continued in my ears and in the still trembling water I could see the sunlight shimmer,
I am thirsty for this water said the little prince,
Give me some to drink,
And I knew then what he had been looking for,
I raised the bucket to his lips,
He drank,
His eyes closed,
It was as sweet as some special festival treat,
This water was something very different from ordinary nourishment,
It was born of the walk under the stars of the song of the pulley of the effort of my arms,
It was good for the heart like a present,
When I was a little boy the lights of the christmas tree the music of the midnight mass the tenderness in the smiles produced in a similar way the radiance of the gift that I received,
The men where you live said the little prince grow five thousand roses in a single garden and they do not find what they are looking for in it,
They do not find it I replied,
And yet what they are looking for could be found in a single rose or in a little water,
That is true I said,
And the little prince added but the eyes are blind,
You have to search with the heart,
I had drunk the water,
I breathed easily,
The sand at sunrise is the color of honey,
This honey color was also making me feel good,
Why then did I have to have this sense of grief,
You have to keep your promise said the little prince softly who had again sat down beside me,
What promise,
You know a muzzle for my sheep,
I am responsible for this flower,
I took my sketches out of my pocket,
The little prince saw them and laughed as he said your baobabs they look a bit like cabbages,
Oh and I had been so proud of my baobabs,
Your fox his ears they look a bit like horns and they are too long,
And then he laughed again,
You are not being fair my little fellow,
I do not know how to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open,
Oh it will be ok he said,
Children understand,
So I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle and I felt a pang in my heart as I gave it to him,
You have plans that I do not know about,
But he did not respond,
He said to me you know my descent to earth tomorrow will be its anniversary,
Then after a silence he went on,
I came down very near here,
And he blushed,
And once again without understanding why I felt a peculiar sense of sorrow,
One question occurred to me however,
So it was not by chance that the morning I first met you a week ago you were out walking like that all alone a thousand miles from any inhabited region,
You were going back to the place where you landed,
The little prince blushed again,
And I added hesitantly perhaps because of the anniversary,
The little prince blushed once more,
He never answered questions but when you blush that means yes,
Does not it,
Oh I said to him,
I am worried,
But he responded now you must work,
You must go back to your engine,
I will wait for you here,
Come back tomorrow evening,
But I was not reassured,
I remembered the fox,
You run the risk of weeping a little if you allow yourself to be tamed,
There was next to the well the ruin of an old stone wall,
When I came back from my work the next evening I saw from a distance my little prince sitting on top of it,
His feet hanging down,
And I heard him say do not you remember,
Then this is not the exact spot,
Another voice must have answered him because he replied yes yes it is the right day but this is not the right place,
I continued my walk toward the wall,
I still did not see or hear anyone yet,
The little prince replied again that is right,
You will see where my tracks begin in the sand,
You just have to wait there for me,
I will be there tonight,
I was twenty meters from the wall and I still saw nothing,
The little prince spoke again after a pause,
Do you have good poison,
Are you sure you will not make me suffer too long,
I froze,
My heart skipped a beat but I still did not understand,
Now go away he said,
I want to come down from here,
I then lowered my eyes to the foot of the wall and I leapt up,
Right there facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that can kill you in thirty seconds flat,
Even as I dug around in my pocket to take out my revolver I made a running step back,
But at the noise I made the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound,
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arms who was white as snow,
What is going on here,
Why are you talking with snakes,
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore,
I had moistened his temples and had him drink,
And now I did not dare ask him anything more,
He looked at me gravely and put his arms around my neck,
I felt his heart beat like the heart of a dying bird when shot with a rifle,
He said to me I am glad that you have found what was wrong with your engine,
Now you will be able to go back home,
How did you know,
I was just coming to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful,
He made no answer to my question but he added I am also going back home today,
Then he said sadly it is a lot further,
It is much more difficult,
I felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening,
I held him tightly in my arms like a small child,
And yet it seemed to me that he was plummeting down into an abyss and that I could do nothing to restrain him,
He had a serious look as if lost far away,
I have your sheep and I have the box for the sheep and I have the muzzle,
And he smiled sadly,
I waited a long while,
I could feel that he was reviving little by little,
My little fellow I said to him,
You are afraid,
He was afraid of course but he laughed softly,
I will be much more afraid this evening,
Again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable and I knew that I could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again,
For me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert,
Little fellow I said I want to hear you laugh again,
But he said to me tonight it will be a year,
My star will be right above the spot where I came down to earth a year ago,
Little fellow is this all a bad dream this business with the snake and the meeting place and the star,
But he did not answer my question,
He said to me that which is important can not be seen,
I know,
It is like with the flower,
If you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night,
All the stars are covered with flowers,
I know,
It is like with the water,
The water you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley and the rope,
You remember,
It was good,
I know,
At night you will look at the stars,
Where I live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is,
It is better like that,
My star will be for you just one of the stars,
So you will love to look at all of the stars,
They will all be your friends,
And besides I am going to make you a present,
He laughed again,
Ah little fellow dear little fellow I love to hear that laugh,
That is my present,
Just that it will be like with the water,
What are you trying to say,
Everyone has the same stars but they are not the same to everyone,
For some who are travelers the stars are guides,
For others they are nothing but little lights,
For others who are scholars they are problems,
For my businessman they were wealth,
But none of these stars say anything back,
You will have the stars as no one else has them,
What are you trying to say,
When you look at the sky at night because I will be living on one of them because I will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the stars are laughing,
You only you will have stars that can laugh,
And he laughed again,
And when your sorrow is comforted time heals all wounds,
You will be glad to have known me,
You will always be my friend,
You will want to laugh with me,
And sometimes you will open your window just like that for fun,
And your friends will be very surprised to see you laughing whilst watching the sky,
So you will tell them yes the stars always make me laugh and they will think you are crazy,
I will have played a dirty trick on you,
And he laughed again,
It will be as if I would given you instead of stars lots and lots of little bells that can laugh,
And he laughed some more,
Then he suddenly became serious again,
Tonight you know do not come,
I will not leave you,
It will look as if I am suffering,
It will look a bit as if I am dying,
It is like that,
Do not come to see that,
It is not worth it,
I will not leave you,
But he was worried,
I am telling you this,
It is also because of the snake,
He must not bite you,
Snakes are mean,
They can bite you just for fun,
I will not leave you,
But something reassured him,
It is true that they have no poison left for a second bite,
That night I did not see him set out,
He got away without making a sound,
When I managed to catch him up he was walking along determinedly at a brisk pace,
He said to me only oh you came,
And he took me by the hand but he was still worrying,
You have made a mistake,
You will suffer,
It will look as if I am dead and that will not be true,
I said nothing,
You understand it is too far,
I can not carry this body with me,
It is too heavy,
I said nothing,
But it will be like an old abandoned shell,
There is nothing sad about old shells,
I said nothing,
He got a bit discouraged but he made one more effort,
You know it will be nice,
I will also look at the stars,
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley,
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink,
I said nothing,
It will be so much fun,
You will have five hundred million little bells and I will have five hundred million springs of fresh water,
And then he too was silent because he was crying,
Here is the place,
Let me go on by myself,
And he sat down because he was afraid,
He said you know my flower I am responsible for her,
And she is so weak,
And she is so naive,
She has four thorns of no use at all to protect herself against the entire world,
I sat down too because I was no longer able to stand,
He said that is everything,
He hesitated a bit and then stood back up,
He took one step,
I could not move,
There was nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle,
He remained motionless for an instant,
He did not cry out,
He fell as gently as a tree falls,
There was not even any sound because of the sand,
And now of course it has already been six years,
I have never yet told this story,
The companions who met me were very happy to see me alive again,
I was sad but I told them it is because I am tired,
Now my sorrow is comforted a little,
I mean not entirely but I do know that he got back to his planet because at daybreak I did not find his body,
It was not a very heavy body,
And I love to listen to the stars at night,
It is just like five hundred million little bells,
But there is one extraordinary thing,
When I drew the muzzle for the little prince I forgot to add the leather strap to it,
He would never have been able to fasten it to the sheep,
So I wonder what happened on his planet,
It may well be the sheep ate the flower,
Sometimes I tell myself surely not the little prince shuts his flower under her glass dome every night and he watches over his sheep very carefully,
Then I am happy and all the stars laugh sweetly,
Other times I tell myself everyone is absent minded at some point and that is all it takes,
One evening he would have forgotten the glass dome or maybe the sheep got out quietly during the night,
And then the little bells turn to tears,
Herein lies a great mystery for you who also love the little prince just like for me,
Nothing in the universe is the same if somewhere out there a sheep that we have never seen has has it eaten a rose,
Look at the sky,
Ask yourselves has the sheep yes or no eaten the flower,
And you will see how everything changes,
And no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of such importance,
This to me is the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world,
It is the same landscape as the one on the previous page,
But I have drawn it again to show it to you properly,
It is here that the little prince appeared on earth and then disappeared,
Look at this landscape carefully so as to be sure to recognize it if one day you travel in africa in the desert,
And if you happen to pass by there I beg you do not hurry on,
Wait a while exactly under the star,
If a child then comes to you if he laughs if he has golden hair if he does not respond when questioned you will easily guess who it is,
So think of me,
Save me from this sorrow,
Write to me quickly to tell me he is back
